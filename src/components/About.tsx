                  As a Full-Stack Engineer with deep expertise in Golang, TypeScript, and Clean Architecture, 
                  I specialize in building mission-critical financial systems that process millions of dollars 
                  in transactions while maintaining the highest security standards.

                  My leadership experience includes leading cross-functional teams of 5+ developers, establishing 
                  engineering best practices, and implementing CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment time by 60%. 
                  I've successfully delivered PCI DSS compliant systems and achieved 99.9% system uptime in production environments.

                <p>
                  Currently serving as Backend Team Lead at AlQaseh, I architect and maintain enterprise-grade 
                  financial systems while mentoring junior developers and driving technical innovation. My passion 
                  for performance optimization and scalable architecture has resulted in systems that serve thousands 
                  of concurrent users with sub-200ms response times.
