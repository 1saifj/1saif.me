# Real-Time Classification of Falls and Activities Using CNN-LSTM Networks

This article presents research on developing an intelligent system for real-time classification of various types of falls and activities of daily living using a hybrid CNN-LSTM neural network architecture.

## Research Overview

Fall detection and activity recognition are critical components in healthcare monitoring systems, particularly for elderly care and rehabilitation programs. Our research focuses on developing a robust machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between different types of falls and normal daily activities in real-time.

## Problem Statement

Traditional fall detection systems often suffer from:
- High false positive rates
- Inability to distinguish between different types of falls
- Limited accuracy in complex movement scenarios
- Lack of real-time processing capabilities

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

The research utilized accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from wearable sensors placed on different body positions. The dataset included:

- **Activities of Daily Living (ADL)**: Walking, sitting, standing, lying down, climbing stairs
- **Fall Types**: Forward falls, backward falls, lateral falls, syncope falls
- **Transition Activities**: Sitting to standing, lying to sitting, etc.

### CNN-LSTM Architecture

The proposed model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal pattern recognition.

## Experimental Results

### Performance Metrics

The CNN-LSTM model achieved the following performance metrics:

1. **Overall Accuracy**: 94.2% across all activity classes
2. **Fall Detection Sensitivity**: 96.8% (correctly identified falls)
3. **Fall Detection Specificity**: 93.1% (correctly identified non-falls)
4. **Real-time Processing**: Average inference time of 15ms per window

## Clinical Applications

This research contributes to the development of intelligent healthcare monitoring systems that can provide real-time fall detection and activity classification for elderly care and rehabilitation programs.

## Conclusion

The CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture demonstrates superior performance in real-time fall detection and activity classification, providing a robust foundation for healthcare monitoring applications.
