# Python for Backend Development and Automation

Python's versatility and readability make it an excellent choice for backend development and automation tasks. In my experience working with complex systems, Python's extensive ecosystem and clean syntax enable rapid development of robust solutions.

## Backend Development with Python

### FastAPI for Modern APIs

FastAPI provides excellent performance and automatic API documentation:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr
from typing import List, Optional
import asyncio
import asyncpg
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI(title="User Management API", version="1.0.0")

class UserCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr
    password: str

class UserResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    created_at: datetime
    
    class Config:
        from_attributes = True
```

The combination of FastAPI for APIs, SQLAlchemy for database operations, and Python's automation capabilities creates a robust foundation for building scalable backend systems and efficient automation solutions.
