# Building a Performant Next.js Website with Tailwind CSS

Next.js has quickly become one of the most popular React frameworks for building modern web applications. Combined with Tailwind CSS, it provides a powerful toolkit for creating fast, responsive, and visually appealing websites. In this post, I'll share my experience building this portfolio website and the key considerations for performance and SEO.

## Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduces several significant improvements over previous versions, particularly in terms of performance and developer experience. Here's how to get started:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-portfolio
```

When prompted, choose to use TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the App Router. These choices set you up for a modern, type-safe, and performant application structure.

## Optimizing Images

One of the biggest performance bottlenecks in web applications is images. Next.js provides the `Image` component, which automatically handles several optimizations:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function OptimizedImage() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/profile.jpg"
      alt="Profile picture"
      width={400}
      height={400}
      priority
    />
  )
}
```

The `Image` component automatically:
- Optimizes image formats (WebP/AVIF)
- Prevents layout shift with proper sizing
- Lazy loads images by default
- Provides responsive sizing

## Implementing Server Components

Next.js 15's server components are a game-changer for performance. They allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript sent to the client and improving loading times:

```tsx
// A server component
export default async function ProjectList() {
  const projects = await fetchProjects()
  
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {projects.map(project => (
        <ProjectCard key={project.id} project={project} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Managing Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind's utility-first approach allows for rapid development without sacrificing customization:

```tsx
export default function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors">
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

Tailwind also automatically purges unused CSS in production, resulting in minimal CSS payloads.

## SEO Considerations

Next.js makes SEO implementation straightforward with its metadata API:

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'My Portfolio | Projects',
  description: 'Explore my latest web development projects',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'My Portfolio | Projects',
    description: 'Explore my latest web development projects',
    images: [
      {
        url: 'https://myportfolio.com/og-image.jpg',
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

## Conclusion

Building a modern, performant website with Next.js and Tailwind CSS is a joy. The combination provides an excellent developer experience while delivering optimal performance for users. As you've seen through these examples, it's possible to create visually appealing interfaces that load quickly and rank well in search engines.

Remember that performance is an ongoing process. Regularly test your site with tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest to identify opportunities for improvement.
